# Takeaway_App

#### Login
Users arrive on the homepage displaying the list of available restaurants and dishes if they click on each restaurant. 

#### To Order
Users must either Login in create an account to place an order. This is fully managed by Strapi CMS, along with the listed restaurants and dishes. Once logged in a user can select whatever dishes they want to order and it will be displayed in their cart.

#### Cart
Once the user has finished choosing their dishes, they click on the order button and this takes them to the checkout section.

#### Checkout
The app has Stripe fully integrated so in this section, the customer can theoretically enter their card details. From a management perspective you are able to see these payments come through as a Test both in the Stripe dashboard, and the Orders section of the Strapi dashboard.
