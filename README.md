## Project Brief (as given by CodeClan):
Build a Shares Portfolio Application. A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

#### Minimum Viable Product requirements (MVP):
* Create an application that displays a user to play a quiz, containing a set of questions
* Allow these questions to be in different categories (Sport, General Knowledge, Music)
* Create a form that allows users to create their own quiz
* Calculate user's score based on the ratio of correct/incorrect answers

#### Example Extensions
* User would also be able to add a single question to our existing database, hence creating a community that actively contributes with questions to our question database)
* Improve section. Reading notes and links to websites on particular topics you want to brush up on.
* Exploring the potential to host multiple users from different locations.
